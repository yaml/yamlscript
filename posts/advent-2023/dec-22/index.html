I've never been up to the North Pole, but I'm pretty sure there's no beaches. I always pictured Santa wearing moon boots around the workshop.</p><p>YAMLScript on the other hand, is all about flip flops!</p><h3>Welcome to Day 22 of the YAMLScript Advent Blog!</h3><p>Remember way back in <a href="../dec-06/">Day 6</a> when we talked about the 3 different YAMLScript modes? They were <strong>bare</strong>, <strong>data</strong> and <strong>code</strong>. The bare mode was what you got then you ran (or loaded) a YAMLScript program with no <code>!yamlscript/v0</code> tag at the top. It just meant that you were effectively stuck in data mode, with no possibility of executing any code.</p><p>There's actually comfort in <strong>bare</strong> mode. You are using YAMLScript to process your data because it is one of the best YAML loaders available, but you don't have to worry about any code being run accidentally.</p><p>Today's post is about the other two modes. Either you are writing a program (thus starting in <strong>code</strong> mode) or you are doing cool stuff with your data files (thus starting in <strong>data</strong> mode).</p><p>In either case you are going to want to switch modes at various places in your YAMLScript. We learned before that you could switch modes by using the <code>!</code> tag. This is the smallest possible tag and we use it for the most common need.</p><p>Here's an example of using YAMLScript to generate data to be loaded. We'll start in code mode by using <code>!yamlscript/v0</code>:</p><pre class="language-yaml"><code class="language-yaml"><span class="token tag">!yamlscript/v0</span><br><br><span class="token key atrule">vars =</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token tag">!</span><br>  <span class="token key atrule">colors</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span><br>  <span class="token punctuation">-</span> red<br>  <span class="token punctuation">-</span> <span class="token tag">!</span> ("gre" + "en")<br>  <span class="token punctuation">-</span> blue<br>  <span class="token key atrule">numbers</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token tag">!</span><br>    <span class="token key atrule">vec</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span><br>      <span class="token key atrule">map \(% * 10)</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token tag">!</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">2</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">3</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span><br>  <span class="token key atrule">awesome</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span> <span class="token key atrule">yaml</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token boolean important">true</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token key atrule">xml</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token tag">!</span> (1 <span class="token punctuation">></span> 2) <span class="token punctuation">}</span><br><br><span class="token key atrule">=></span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token tag">!</span><br><span class="token punctuation">-</span> <span class="token tag">!</span> <span class="token string">"$(vars.colors.1) with envy"</span><br><span class="token punctuation">-</span> <span class="token tag">!</span> <span class="token string">"Four score and $(vars.numbers.1) years ago"</span><br><span class="token punctuation">-</span> <span class="token tag">!</span> <span class="token string">"Santa wears flip flops. $(vars.awesome.yaml) or $(vars.awesome.xml)?"</span></code></pre><p>That's more bangs than a fireworks show in a barbershop!</p><p>This was just a crazy way to get the following data:</p><pre class="language-yaml"><code class="language-yaml"><span class="token punctuation">-</span> green with envy<br><span class="token punctuation">-</span> Four score and 20 years ago<br><span class="token punctuation">-</span> Santa wears flip flops. true or false<span class="token punctuation">?</span></code></pre><p>Every time you see a <code>!</code> tag, it means that we are switching modes from <code>code</code> to <code>data</code> or vice versa.</p><p>Let's walk through it:</p><ul><li><code>!yamlscript/v0</code> - This tag starts the program in <code>code</code> mode. If we wanted to start in <code>data</code> mode, we would use <code>!yamlscript/v0/data</code>.</li><li><code>vars =: !</code> - We are setting the value of a variable named <code>vars</code> to the some data we want to write in plain old YAML. Before we can do that, we need to switch to <code>data</code> mode.</li><li><code>! (&quot;gre&quot; + &quot;en&quot;)</code> - This is a YAMLScript expression that evaluates to the string <code>green</code>. To let YAMLScript know that we want to evaluate this expression, we switch back to <code>code</code> mode.</li><li><code>numbers: !</code> - Even though we just switched to <code>code</code> mode, in the previous point, it was only for that scalar / expression. We need to do it again since the mapping we are in is in data mode.</li></ul><p>And so on. Note that when we switch modes we do it only for that node, not for the whole rest of the document.</p><h3>A Better Flip Flop Syntax</h3><p>The <code>!</code> tag is ok for switching modes, but even though it's one character, I find it a bit noisy. Here's another way to switch modes:</p><pre class="language-yaml"><code class="language-yaml"><span class="token tag">!yamlscript/v0</span><br><br>vars =<span class="token punctuation">:</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span><br>  <span class="token key atrule">colors</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span><br>  <span class="token punctuation">-</span> red<br>  <span class="token punctuation">-</span> <span class="token tag">!</span> ("gre" + "en")<br>  <span class="token punctuation">-</span> blue<br>  numbers<span class="token punctuation">:</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span><br>    <span class="token key atrule">vec</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span><br>      map \(% * 10)<span class="token punctuation">:</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">2</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">3</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span><br>  <span class="token key atrule">awesome</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span> <span class="token key atrule">yaml</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token boolean important">true</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> xml<span class="token punctuation">:</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> (1 <span class="token punctuation">></span> 2) <span class="token punctuation">}</span><br><br>=<span class="token punctuation">></span><span class="token punctuation">:</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span><br><span class="token punctuation">-</span> <span class="token tag">!</span> <span class="token string">"$(vars.colors.1) with envy"</span><br><span class="token punctuation">-</span> <span class="token tag">!</span> <span class="token string">"Four score and $(vars.numbers.1) years ago"</span><br><span class="token punctuation">-</span> <span class="token tag">!</span> <span class="token string">"Santa wears flip flops. $(vars.awesome.yaml) or $(vars.awesome.xml)?"</span></code></pre><p>When a <code>!</code> tag follows a <code>:</code> key/value separator, we can use a <code>::</code> instead to mean the same thing.</p><p>There are still bangs in there because they didn't follow a <code>:</code>.</p><hr><p>I find the <code>::</code> syntax to be a bit more readable.</p><p>Note that this isn't a special new YAML syntax. It's simply an unquoted key that ends with a colon.</p><p>This trick works from both code and data modes. It does not work from bare mode. You'll just have a mapping key that ends with a colon.</p><p>It might seem like using the <code>!</code> or <code>::</code> as a toggle could get confusing because you need to keep track of which mode you are in.</p><p>But typically it's pretty obvious for a person reading the YAML. Machines need to be more exact.</p><p>I suspect that I'll introduce the <code>!code</code> and <code>!data</code> tags in the future, for when you feel the need to be explicit.</p><hr><p>That was a quick post but also an important one for learning how to write better YAMLScript.</p><p>See you tomorrow for Day 23 of the YAMLScript Advent Blog!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><details><summary style="color:#888">Santa's little secrets...</summary><p>In December 2023 YAMLScript is a work in progress.</p><p>This is not to say that it's a toy proof of concept. It has a working compiler, runtime and CLI. It has unit tests that must pass for every commit pushed to the main branch. It's well thought out and has a clear direction that I continually vet with a small group of talented and trusted people. It has regular <a href="https://github.com/yaml/yamlscript/releases">releases</a>.</p><p>But that in turn not to say that you should use it in production today. I encourage you to start playing with it, and I'm committed to backwards compatibility for stable releases. But we're not quite there yet. Caveat usor!</p><p>YAMLScript is evolving fast. While I'm writing these posts, I'm also writing the code for new features and fixing bugs as I go. I've had the Advent plan for over a month now, and I had planned to be further along before December 1st, but such are the time estimates of hackers.</p><p>I am attempting to make sure that the code examples in these posts are always using the implemented features, but sometimes I may fall a few hours behind. Often I need to write the examples using code patterns that actually work but are not the ones I preferred to best make a point.</p><p>As I fix bugs, implement features and tweak the language, I will update the posts accordingly. If you see something that bugs you, try taking another look after a few days. It probably bugged me too!</p><p>Be patient with me.</p><p>If I had to guess, I'd say that YAMLScript v0 will be have a stable release sometime before March 2024. I'll continue blogging the progress as I go, so it shouldn't be hard for you to decide when to start using YAMLScript for real.</p><p>Overall the whole thing is going extremely well, and I'm having a lot of fun. It's important to be transparent with you about where things are at.</p><p>Stick with me... This is going to be awesome!</p><p>— Ingy döt Net</p></details></main><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__tags"><a href="/tags/blog/">#blog</a> <a href="/tags/advent-2023/">#advent-2023</a></div><nav class="post__pagination"><a href="/posts/advent-2023/dec-21/"><span>←</span> <span>YAML, Python and the Holy Graal</span> </a><a href="/posts/advent-2023/index/"><span>2023 Advent Index</span> <span>→</span></a></nav></aside></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__content"><ul class="hero__social-links"><li><a href="https://github.com/yaml/yamlscript" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a></li><li><a href="/feed.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RSS</a></li></ul><p class="footer__attribution">Powered by <a href="https://www.11ty.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eleventy</a>.
