Legends have histories. The histories of Santa are many and varied, some going back to the 4th century AD.</p><p>YAMLScript's history is much shorter, but it's still a history. Today I'd like to tell you a little bit about it.</p><h3>Welcome to Day 13 of the YAMLScript Advent Calendar!</h3><p>In the summer of 2022 I was gathering information about a computer system that I was learning about. I was putting the information into a YAML file. At first I thought to myself, this YAML file could essentially be a configuration file for running the system. Then I thought, what if I could run the system by just &quot;running&quot; the YAML file?</p><p>Hmmmm... YAMLScript! For me a project can only be started when it has a name. I had the name, I loved the name, I loved the idea, I started the project!</p><p>I put together a prototype as a Perl module and published it to CPAN. I knew that conceptually YAMLScript would be a Lisp, but to be honest I barely knew what a Lisp was.</p><h3>One True YAML</h3><p>Earlier in the year I had come to the conclusion that the YAML spec and all of the YAML implementations were too hard to fix. I had spent the second half of 2021 trying to fix YAML, with a <a href="https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/ext/team/">core group</a> of five people, and it slowly became obvious that it was a lost cause. It was just too much work to get everyone to agree on anything, let alone everything.</p><p>A possibly better solution was to create a new YAML framework (based on the current YAML 1.2 spec) and publish it in 42 different languages.</p><p>At least this way there would be a set of quality YAML implementations that were the same in every language. The main problem with this idea was simply learning (and remembering!) how to publish a library in 42 different languages!</p><p>I decided to write a meta publishing framework that would allow me to publish to any language using the same simple commands. I called this framework <a href="https://github.com/ingydotnet/pst">PST - Package Super Tool</a>.</p><p>In doing that I had to pick 42 languages and start learning a bit about each of them. At some point I came across Clojure and thought it was interesting.</p><h3>Make a Lisp</h3><p>Around the start of 2023 I started thinking about YAMLScript again. My fledgling language with just a toy implementation in Perl. I knew YAMLScript was going to be a Lisp, but I didn't know much about Lisps. I asked the internet how to make a Lisp and it told me to read <a href="https://github.com/kanaka/mal/blob/master/process/guide.md">Make a Lisp</a>!</p><p>Make a Lisp (Mal) is a project that walks you through making a baby Clojure-inspired Lisp implementation in the programming language of your choice. It has eleven chapters, each with a set of tests that you must pass before you can move on to the next chapter. At the end you have a working Lisp implementation and you have to use it to run the Mal implementation written in Mal and make sure it passes all the tests!</p><p>I decided to do Mal in Perl (even though there was already a Perl implementation). There are nearly 100 implementations of Mal in over 70 different languages. It took me about 2 weeks to get through the whole thing. By the end I really felt like I knew what a Lisp was, how Lisps worked and how to make one.</p><p>When I finish the Mal course I decided to do it again but this time in YAMLScript, a language that didn't exist yet. This was really easy and fun. I just ported the Mal in Mal code to a YAML form that I found pleasing and acceptable as a programming language; essentially making up YAMLScript as I went along.</p><p>I also wanted to go much further with the Perl implementation. I decided I would create a full implementation of Clojure on Perl based off of my Mal in Perl code. I call this project <a href="https://github.com/lingy-lang/lingy">Lingy</a> (currently <a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/Lingy">available on CPAN</a>). This is when I started learning Clojure. (Spring 2023).</p><h3>TPRC 2023</h3><p>I was also helping to organize the <a href="tprc.to">TPRC 2023</a> (Perl and Raku) conference. I decided I would give a talk called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OcFh-HaCyI">Lingy and YAMLScript</a>. I had to get a working Lingy and a working YAMLScript implementation in Perl by the end of June.</p><p>After I gave the talk I noticed it was getting a lot of attention. A lot more views on youtube than any other talk at the conference. I realized this was happening because the words &quot;Clojure&quot; and &quot;Java&quot; were in the talk description.</p><h3>The Clojure Community</h3><p>A lovely man named Peter Strömberg reached out to me and asked if I would be interested in joining the <a href="https://clojurians.slack.com/">Clojure Community Slack</a>. Peter is the author of <a href="https://calva.io/">Calva</a>, a Clojure IDE for VS Code, one of the best ways to write and work with Clojure. I joined right away and he pointed me in all the right directions and got me talking to all the right people.</p><p>I soon learned about <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/">GraalVM</a> and <a href="https://github.com/babashka/sci">SCI</a> written by Michiel Borkent, a man to whom I owe much credit for helping me with many deep technical issues I encountered. Michiel is the author of <a href="https://babashka.org/">Babashka</a>, a popular way to do shell scripting in Clojure. SCI is the Clojure runtime engine that Babashka uses and that YAMLScript now uses as well!</p><p>All the pieces started falling into place, and I got a clear vision of what YAMLScript should become... AND how relatively easy it would be to make it happen thanks to the Clojure ecosystem. I started rewriting the YAMLScript compiler and runtime in Clojure and rebuilding it into what it is today.</p><h3>December 1st, 2023</h3><p>At some point in the Fall, I decided that I would start blogging about YAMLScript every day in December 2023, in the Programming Project Advent Calendar style.</p><p>I thought I would easily get everything done by Dec 1st but to be honest, even as I write this now, there is still so much to do. Some days I really want to write about a particular topic, but the code isn't quite ready yet.</p><p>But all that said, it's all working out pretty dang well. I'm loving this language and project!</p><p>I have the highest hopes of hopes for YAMLScript in 2024.</p><p>There's a lot more details I could add here but it's getting late and I need to get some sleep.</p><h3>Join me again tomorrow for Day 14 of the YAMLScript Advent Calendar!</h3></main><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__tags"><a href="/tags/blog/">#blog</a> <a href="/tags/advent-2023/">#advent-2023</a></div><nav class="post__pagination"><a href="/posts/advent-2023/dec-12/"><span>←</span> <span>Future Proof</span> </a><a href="/posts/advent-2023/dec-14/"><span>Stocking Stuffers</span> <span>→</span></a></nav></aside></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__content"><ul class="hero__social-links"><li><a href="https://github.com/yaml/yamlscript" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a></li><li><a href="/feed.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RSS</a></li></ul><p class="footer__attribution">Powered by <a href="https://www.11ty.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eleventy</a>.
