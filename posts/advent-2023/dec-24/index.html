Let's put a bow on it and deliver it to the world.</p><p>First we should take a moment to reflect on what we've learned this month. We can also take a look forward to what's coming up in the New Year.</p><h3>The 50,000 Foot View</h3><p>We'll start with a high level look at the landscape YAMLScript promises to be.</p><ul><li>YAMLScript is new programming language</li><li>You write YAMLScript in YAML<ul><li>JSON is also YAML</li><li>All JSON and most YAML is valid YAMLScript</li></ul></li><li>YAMLScript compiles to Clojure<ul><li>Clojure is a Lisp and a Functional Programming (FP) language</li><li>YAMLScript a functional language with a Lisp model</li><li>YAMLScript ia a complete language (since Clojure is)</li></ul></li><li>YAMLScript's engine is a native binary executable<ul><li>No JVM involved; no slow startup</li><li>YAMLScript starts fast and runs fast</li><li>YAMLScript programs can compile to binary executables</li></ul></li><li>YAMLScript has a clean syntax that feels Pythonic<ul><li>YeS-Expressions offer infix operators and prefix function calls</li><li>Can also be written in a full-Lisp style</li><li>Or full-non-Lisp or anywhere in between</li><li>There are many ways to write the same expression in YS</li></ul></li><li>YAMLScript embeds cleanly into existing YAML files<ul><li>Good for simplifying and enhancing existing YAML files</li><li>Include parts of other YAML files into any part of a YAML file</li><li>Map, filter and transform YAML data to more YAML data</li></ul></li><li>YAMLScript can use libraries written in Clojure or YAMLScript<ul><li>Lots of existing Clojure libraries will work with YAMLScript</li><li>YAMLScript libraries can be written in YAMLScript</li><li>YAMLScript can be used as a scripting language</li></ul></li><li>YAMLScript provides the <code>ys</code> command line tool<ul><li>Compile YAMLScript files to Clojure code</li><li>Compile YAMLScript files to native binary executables</li><li>Convert between YAML, JSON and EDN</li><li>Eval YAMLScript expressions from the command line</li></ul></li><li>YAMLScript provides the <code>libyamlscript</code> shared library<ul><li>Bindable to most programming languages</li><li>Growing number of languages have YS binding modules</li><li>Load plain old YAML files more correctly</li><li>Load YAML files with embedded transformation code</li><li>Run subtasks written in YAMLScript from another language</li></ul></li></ul><h3>The State of the YAMLScript</h3><p>YAMLScript is a year and a half old from inception, but it really found its direction in July 2023.</p><p>It is now a working programming language with:</p><ul><li>A compiler</li><li>A mature runtime</li><li>A mature standard library</li><li>Binding modules in several programming languages</li><li>Regular binary releases for Linux, Mac (x64 and ARM)</li><li>Simple one-line installer commands</li><li>Example programs on Rosetta Code</li></ul><p>Many things remain to be done:</p><ul><li>Windows support</li><li>Finish the v0 compiler</li><li>YAMLScript v0 specification</li><li>Test suite with complete coverage</li><li>User documentation and tutorials</li><li>Binding modules for most modern programming languages</li><li>A YAMLScript module registry</li></ul><p>to name a few.</p><h3>What Lies Ahead</h3><p>The complete scope and trajectory of YAMLScript is unknown. I'm confident that it will be used in ways I can't even imagine.</p><p>This notion is built into the design of YAMLScript. Stating the explicit API version (<code>v0</code>) is a mandatory part of the writing and using YAMLScript code. Version 1 can completely break away from version 0, and no existing code will be affected.</p><p>I already have exciting plans queued up for the next year:</p><ul><li>IDE support (Calva + source maps)</li><li>The YAMLScript Macro System</li><li>nREPL server support</li><li>Top notch error messages</li><li>Cross language shared library auto-binding</li><li>Use case tutorials and examples<ul><li>Simplifying massive YAML deployment files</li><li>Using YAMLScript for better CI/CD workflows</li><li>Task automation with YAMLScript</li></ul></li></ul><h3>The End of an Advent</h3><p>I hope you've enjoyed this year's YAMLScript Advent Blog. I enjoyed writing it but I'm relieved that it's finally over. It's one thing to write a blog post every day and another to be working around the clock trying to implement everything you're writing about.</p><p>Those things I've listed above deserve more explanation. Perhaps they each deserve their own blog post! I look forward to telling you about each of them in detail. But...</p><p>I'm going to take the rest of the year off from blogging about YAMLScript. I'll keep working on the language itself because that's just pure fun for me. (Usually.)</p><p>I'll be back in January and I'll try to put out a blog post every week or two. From now on I don't have to blog about things that I just barely got working after burning the midnight oil.</p><p>I'm so excited about this language!!!</p><p>I knew that doing this advent calendar was going to be a huge challenge, but I also knew that it was just the thing to drive YAMLScript forward. The alternative was to wait a full year for Advent 2024. Thank goodness for my ADD. (Advent Driven Development)</p><p>Happy Holidays to you and yours.</p><p>I'll see you in the future.</p><p>Don't forget your sunglasses.</p><p>The future is bright!!!</p><p>— Ingy döt Net and the YAMLScript Elves</p></main><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__tags"><a href="/tags/blog/">#blog</a> <a href="/tags/advent-2023/">#advent-2023</a></div><nav class="post__pagination"><a href="/posts/advent-2023/dec-23/"><span>←</span> <span>Perl to Rust</span> </a><a href="/posts/advent-2023/index/"><span>2023 Advent Index</span> <span>→</span></a></nav></aside></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__content"><ul class="hero__social-links"><li><a href="https://github.com/yaml/yamlscript" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a></li><li><a href="/feed.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RSS</a></li></ul><p class="footer__attribution">Powered by <a href="https://www.11ty.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eleventy</a>.
