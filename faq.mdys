```mdys::question
How do you pronounce YS?

We like to say "wise" since its how you might pronounce the plural of "Y".  You
can also say "why-ess" for "Y S" or the long name for YS: "YAMLScript" ("YAML
(rhymes with camel) Script").

YS has many side projects like [HelmYS](helmys.md) ("helm-wise") or
[SchemaYS](#) ("schema-wise").
```


```mdys::question
Is YS really YAML?

Yes. Empirically.
The YS compiler has 7 stages (phases) to transform YS (YAML) into Clojure.
The first phase is call `parse` and it currently uses the
[SnakeYAML Engine parser](
https://github.com/snakeyaml/snakeyaml-engine/blob/master/src/main/java/org/snakeyaml/engine/v2/parser/Parser.java)
code for this process.
```


```mdys::question
Who created YS?

YS was created by [Ingy d√∂t Net](ingydotnet.md), a founding creator and current
maintainer of the [YAML Data Language](https://yaml.org).
```


```mdys::question
What is the preferred file extension for YS files?

The preferred file extension for YS files is `.ys`, but you can use `.yaml` or
`.yml` if you prefer for most files.
The `ys` command line tool doesn't look at the file extension and will treat
them all the same.

If you are enhancing an existing YAML file, there is no need to change the file
extension to `.ys`. You can just start using YS features in the file.

On the other hand, YS libraries loaded with the `use` function are required to
have the `.ys` extension.
```


```mdys::question
Clojure is a JVM language. Does YS need the JVM?

No. YS is written in Clojure and exposes the Clojure/Java runtime ecosystem, but
there is no JVM involved.
This is thanks to the [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/) project's
[native-image](https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/)
which can compile anything compiled to jar files into a standalone native binary
executable or shared library.

This is how the `ys` binary and the `libyamlscript.so` shared library are
created.

!!! note
    Even the YS build system does not require you to have any Java or Clojure
    stuff installed.
    It simply downloads a GraalVM tarball into `/tmp`, and the Makefile takes
    care of everything without leaving any mess behind.
```


```mdys::question
Do I need to know Clojure to use YS?

All YS/YAML code is compiled to Clojure and evaluated when you run or load it.

That said, you can get pretty far with YS without knowing any Clojure.
Just read the docs and look at the examples.

To become a YS expert, you will need to know Clojure (and YAML) well.
