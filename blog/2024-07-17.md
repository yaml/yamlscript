Last week two new language bindings were added to the YS family:
[Go](https://github.com/yaml/yamlscript-go) and
[Julia](https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages/General/YAMLScript).

## Go

The [Go](https://go.dev/) binding has been a long time coming.
Several people have been working on it this year but it was [Andrew Pam](
https://github.com/xanni) who finally got it over the finish line.

Go is a big user of the YAML data language, so we're happy to be able to provide
this library and hope to see it used in many Go projects.


## Julia

The [Julia](https://julialang.org/) binding was a bit more of a recent surprise
addition.
A few weeks ago a Julia hacker dropped by the [YAML Chat Room](
https://matrix.to/#/#chat:yaml.io) to ask some questions about YAML.
I ended up asking him more about Julia and if he could help write a YS binding.

He invited [Kenta Murata](https://github.com/mrkn) to the chat room and Kenta
said he could do it for us.
Then Kenta disappeared for a few weeks.
Last week he came back with a fully working Julia binding for YS!

Fun fact: Julia is [Clark Evans](https://github.com/clarkevans) favorite
programming language!
Clark is one of the original authors of the YAML data language.


## YS Loader Libraries

These YS language bindings are intended to be an alternative YAML loader
library for the respective languages.
They can load normal existing YAML files in a consistent way, and common API
across all languages.
They can also load YAML files with embedded YS code, to achieve data importing,
transformation, interpolation; anything a programming language can do.

The current list of YS loader libraries is:

* [Clojure](https://clojars.org/org.yamlscript/clj-yamlscript)
* [Go](https://github.com/yaml/yamlscript-go)
* [Java](https://clojars.org/org.yamlscript/yamlscript)
* [Julia](https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages/General/YAMLScript)
* [NodeJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@yaml/yamlscript)
* [Perl](https://metacpan.org/pod/YAMLScript)
* [Python](https://pypi.org/project/yamlscript/)
* [Raku](https://raku.land/zef:ingy/YAMLScript)
* [Ruby](https://rubygems.org/gems/yamlscript)
* [Rust](https://crates.io/crates/yamlscript)


## Join the Fun!

If your language is missing a YS binding or you want to help improve one,
please drop by the [YS Chat Room](https://matrix.to/#/#chat-yamlscript:yaml.io)
and we'll get you started.

All of the bindings are part of the [YS Mono-Repo](
https://github.com/yaml/yamlscript) on GitHub.
If you look at the existing bindings, you'll see that they are all quite small.
You'll need to learn about basic FFI (Foreign Function Interface) for your
language, to make calls to the YS shared library `libys`, but that's about it.

It's a great way to get started with a new language project.


## Some Future Plans

There's a lot of upcoming work planned for YS.
I've mapped some of it out in the [YS Roadmap](
https://github.com/orgs/yaml/projects/6/views/1).

Currently YS (written in [Clojure](https://clojure.org/), which compiles to JVM
bytecode, which…) compiles to a native binary interpreter using the
[GraalVM `native-image` compiler](
https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/).
This is great for performance and distribution, but it's not great for
portability, limiting it to Linux, MacOS and Windows.

The JVM is a great platform for portability, so we're planning to make a JVM
version of the `ys` YS interpreter.
Of course, having YS available as a JVM language is also a good thing
for Linux, MacOS and Windows users.

We also want to make [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/), JavaScript and C++
versions of the YS interpreter.

And of course we still want to get to our goal of 42 language bindings!!!

Lots of fun stuff to explore!
