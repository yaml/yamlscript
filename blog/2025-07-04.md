[Last week](2025-06-27.md) I told you about [YS on Rosetta Code](
https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:YAMLScript) and [yesterday](
2025-07-03.md) I told you about [YS on Exercism](
https://exercism.org/tracks/yamlscript).

Today I'm going to show you how to compare solutions to the same Rosetta Code
task using all the Exercism languages!

## The Gist

There are lots of ways to implement the FizzBuzz problem in YS, but here's one:

```yaml
!YS-v0

defn main(n=100):
  each x (1 .. n): !:say
    or? _ x:
      str ((x % 3).! &&& 'Fizz'):
          ((x % 5).! &&& 'Buzz')
```

This is the way it's [implemented on Rosetta Code](
https://rosettacode.org/wiki/FizzBuzz#YAMLScript).

Let's try it out:

```bash
$ ys fizzbuzz.ys 16
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
16
```

What if we wanted to compare this solution to the solutions in all of the
Exercism languages?

Without further ado, here's a Gist that shows just that:
<https://gist.github.com/ingydotnet/9ece4af186c6a6dcfd589c446dab9b38>.

Compare FizzBuzz in YS to FizzBuzz in 60 other languages.

The coolest part?

That webpage was generated and posted as a GitHub Gist by a YS program!
