Ever heard of a **YS Exorcism**?!

Sounds pretty scary!

A [YS Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/yamlscript) on the other hand is one
of the best ways to learn YS.

[Exercism.org](https://exercism.org) is a free programming learning site with
tracks for over 75 languages!

I'm not going to write much about it here, today, but I encourage you to try out
the Exercism YS track for yourself.

Then let me know what you think here in the comments.

The YS track has 60 exercises for you to try out.

When you finish an exercise, you can request mentor feedback on it.
You'll probably end up interacting with yours truly!

Tomorrow I'll show you a really cool hack I did with YS and Exercism.
