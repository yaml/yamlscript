YS is a functional programming language.

Therefore we should be able to write functions in YS.

This week I want to do a mini-series of blog posts about using and writing
functions in YS.

Let's get started!

## Defining Functions


Defining functions in YS is easy.

```yaml
# File: add.ys
!YS-v0

defn add(a b):
  a + b

say: add(ARGS*)
```

Let's run it:

```
$ ys add.ys 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
42
```

Nice!


## Return Values

In YS (like other Lisp influenced languages) the last expression in a function
is the return value.

You don't use a `return` keyword to return a value.

With that said, I'm going to "return" to my Summer afternoon.

I know this was a short post, but, well, the day kind of got away from me.

I'll have a lot more tomorrow.
