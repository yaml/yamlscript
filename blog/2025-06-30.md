From the start, YAML has always been about making data clean and easy to read.

This carries over to YS code as well.

Even though YS code compiles to Clojure, YS often has shorter alternatives for
Clojure's commonly used and longer function names.

## To Name a Few

Here are some shorter alternative functions that YS provides.
Note: you can almost always use the Clojure version if you want to.

`say` is short for [`println`](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/println).
This is one of the most commonly used functions and found in almost every
program.

`a` is short for [`identity`](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/identity).

`len` is short for [`count`](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/count).
`count` isn't that long, but lots of languages use `len` for this.
In YS you can use either!
Or even use `.#` in a chaining context.

`out` and `err` are short for [`print`](
https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/print) to stdout and stderr respectively.

`read` and `write` are short for [`slurp`](
https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/slurp) and [`spit`](
https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/spit) respectively.
`write` is longer, but `spit` is gross!

`q` is short for [`quote`](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/quote).
In YS, a single quote is used for a string literal that doesn't have
interpolation semantics.
In Clojure, a single quote is used for form quoting (using a form without
evaluating it) and is just sugar for the `quote` function.
For instance in Clojure you might do `'(1 2 3)`.
In YS you'd use `q((1 2 3))` or `(1 2 3):q`

!!! note "To my Clojure Friends"

    I know that `quote` isn't really a function; it's a special form.
    And I know that I've called macros "functions" in this series.
    Forgive me, but it's just not that important to make the distinction; at
    least not at this point.

    Also, macros are much less important to YS than they are to Clojure.
    I'll explain why in a future post.

`chomp` is short for [`str/trim-newline`](
https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.string/trim-newline).

`uc` and `lc` are short for [`str/upper-case`](
https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.string/upper-case) and [`str/lower-case`](
https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.string/lower-case) respectively.

`uc1` is short for [`str/capitalize`](
https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.string/capitalize).

`index` and `rindex` are short for [`str/index-of`](
https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.string/index-of) and [`str/last-index-of`](
https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.string/last-index-of) respectively.

`replace1` is short for [`str/replace-first`](
https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.string/replace-first).

`now` returns a time object.



## Casting Shorties

YS has a bunch of functions whose job is to cast a value from one type to
another.
Functions like `to-int`, `to-map` and `to-char`.
Each of these has a single character short name:

* `B` is short for `to-bool` (boolean)
* `C` is short for `to-char` (character)
* `F` is short for `to-float` (floating point number)
* `I` is short for `to-int` (integer)
* `K` is short for `to-keyw` (keyword)
* `L` is short for `to-list` (list)
* `M` is short for `to-map` (mapping)
* `N` is short for `to-num` (number)
* `O` is short for `to-omap` (ordered mapping)
* `S` is short for `to-str` (string)
* `T` is short for `to-type` (string name of the type)
* `V` is short for `to-vec` (vector)

(Maybe we'll talk about YS's data types later this week.)

There's also a few data collection type constructors that take a list of values:

* `L+` is short for `list`
* `M+` is short for `hash-map`
* `O+` is short for `omap`
* `V+` is short for `vector`

* `T?` is short for `truey?`
* `F?` is short for `falsey?`


## Global Shorties

Clojure has a set of variables called builtin dynamic variables.
They have funny looking names like `*out*` and `*command-line-args*`.
They are sometimes referred to as "earmuff variables" because they begin and end
with an asterisk.

Theses names are invalid syntax in YS.
In YS we call them global variables, they use capital letters, and their names
are usually short.

* `IN` is short for `*in*` (stdin)
* `OUT` is short for `*out*` (stdout)
* `ERR` is short for `*err*` (stderr)
* `ARGV` is short for `*command-line-args*` (command line arguments)
* `ARGS` is `ARGV` with number arguments auto-casted
* `NS` is short for `*ns*` (current namespace)
* `VERSION` is short for `*clojure-version*` (but for the YS version)
* `RUN` is a mapping of runtime information
* `ENV` is a mapping of environment variables
* `FILE` is short for `*file*` (current file)

That's it for today.
I could probably `say` more on this topic, but...

Let's keep it short!
