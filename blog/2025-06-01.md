Today starts a 3 month long, daily summertime journey into the intricacies of
YAML and the wisdom of YS!
Put on your favorite pair of coding sunglasses, grab a refreshing config drink,
and let's get started!

Back in March I promised to start writing more often about all the ways that YS
can help you out day-to-day with your YAML interactions.
When I last posted here it was barely Spring and now Spring is turning into
Summer.

Seasonal turning points be damned, I think of Summer as June, July, and August.
In other words...

**It's Summer dammit!**

Let's declare this Summer, **The Summer of YS**!

## Summertime... and the YAML's Easy

Wanna learn 92 cool things about YAML and YS this Summer?
That's one per day, for 3 months!

I've attempted some crazy things in my days (with both success and failure), and
this feels pretty crazy, but I'm gonna give it a shot.

I'll post one (mostly short) blog post here each day until the end of August
(mostly) about YAML and/or YS.


## Today's Handy Tip

I'm not gonna just announce this fiasco and leave you hanging until tomorrow for
your first tip.
Let's get into it.

----

I like to keep the lines of most of my text files (including the markdown of
this very blog post) at 80 characters or less.
You might have a different preference (I still love you) but that's how I roll.

YAML is pretty good at letting you wrap long strings at places of your choosing.

```
phrase1: The quick brown fox jumped up and down
  and all around while the lazy dog just lay
  all day with nothing to say.
phrase2:
  The quick brown fox jumped up and down and all
  around while the lazy dog just lay all day
  with nothing to say.
phrase3: "The quick brown fox jumped up and down and all around while the lazy dog just lay all day with nothing to say."
phrase4: "\
  The quick brown fox jumped up and down and all around
  while the lazy dog just lay all day with nothing to say."
phrase5: >
  The quick brown fox jumped up and down and all around
  while the lazy dog just lay all day with nothing to say.
```

These values are all the same.
They just use different YAML syntax to wrap the string.
YAML generally wraps multiline strings, by collapsing a newline (and leading
whitespace) into a single space.

But what if you have a long string with no whitespace at all?
This is a common problem when you have long URLs in your YAML files.

There is a way to split these long strings in YAML, and it only works with
double quoted scalars.

```yaml
loong: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/ingydotnet/2e5a79b0b29e548a39a90dba10846042/raw/c05feff49521caf004b5656dcb0e94715a30fffd/stdin
short: "https://gist.githubusercontent.com/\
        ingydotnet/\
        2e5a79b0b29e548a39a90dba10846042/\
        raw/\
        c05feff49521caf004b5656dcb0e94715a30fffd/\
        stdin"
```

Just use a backslash at the end of each line in a double quoted scalar and it
will collapse without a space.

**Are these 2 values exactly the same?**

I don't have a magic 8-ball, so let's use (_wise ol'_) YS to find out!

```
$ ys -pe '_.short == _.loong' - <<'...'
loong: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/ingydotnet/2e5a79b0b29e548a39a90dba10846042/raw/c05feff49521caf004b5656dcb0e94715a30fffd/stdin
short: "https://gist.githubusercontent.com/\
        ingydotnet/\
        2e5a79b0b29e548a39a90dba10846042/\
        raw/\
        c05feff49521caf004b5656dcb0e94715a30fffd/\
        stdin"
...
true
```

    ## _**It is decidedly so!**_


## See You Tomorrow!

One down, 91 to go!

How hard can this be?

Tomorrow I think I'll show you how to use variables in YAML.
You always wanted to know, right?
