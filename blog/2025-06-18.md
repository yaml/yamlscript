Most languages support a `case` or `switch` construct which is a way to handle
multiple conditions.

YS supports several similar but different constructs for this.

Today we'll focus on the `cond` and `case` functions.

<!-- more -->

## Using `cond`

The `cond` function takes an ordered set of pairs each consisting of a predicate
and an action.
Since we are writing code in YAML, it uses mappings for this.
Each pair has a predicate key and an action value.

```yaml
# cond.ys
!YS-v0
each x [-1 2 30 400 5000 "sixty thousand"]:
  kind =:
    cond:
      x:int?:not: "not a"
      x < 0:      "a negative"
      x < 10:     "a single digit"
      x < 100:    "a double digit"
      x < 1000:   "a triple digit"
      else:       "a huge"
  say: "$x is $kind number"
```

Let's run it:

```bash
$ ys cond.ys
-1 is a negative number
2 is a single digit number
30 is a double digit number
400 is a triple digit number
5000 is a huge number
sixty thousand is not a number
```

The `cond` function tries each predicate in order until one of them is true.
Then it applies the action of that predicate and it is finished.


## Just in `case`

There's a similar function called `case`.
This one takes a value and a set of things it might be equal to.
The set consists of a mapping whose pairs contain a value and an action.
The `case` function also supports an `else` pair, like `cond`.

```
# case.ys
!YS-v0
each n (1 .. 4):
  say:
    case n:
      1: "One for the money."
      2: "Two for the show."
      3: "Three to get ready."
      else: "Now, go cat, go!"
```

And then:

```bash
$ ys case.ys
One for the money.
Two for the show.
Three to get ready.
Now, go cat, go!
```

Your YS wish is my command.

Gotta go!

See you tomorrow.
