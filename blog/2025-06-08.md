How did YAML get started in the first place?

Today's Sunday post is about YAML, not YS.

But since YS is YAML, I think that's OK.

This is the story of how the [YAML data language](
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) got its start as far back as [1999](
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rblt2EtFfC4).

    I'm not sure how many people are reading this series, but I'm enjoying
    writing it.
    It's nice to know that I'm not alone on this Summer journey.

    I recently added Reactions and Comments support to these blog posts.
    Scroll down to the bottom of each post to see them.

    If you are enjoying the [**Summer of YS**](
    http://0.0.0.0:8000/blog/category/summer-of-ys/) series, please don't forget
    to react (and comment if you want to) to let me know!

    I originally wrote this blog post [back in 2020](
    https://yaml.com/blog/2020-12/in-the-beginning/) but I thought it would be
    a good addition to the Summer of YS series.


## (Read the following) like it's 1999

The web was taking over the world.

Rich content was flying around the globe and into your eyeballs in milliseconds,
all delivered as a plain text package.

HTML!

Amazing!

Hey, let's abstract HTML/SGML a bit and it will become the end-all format for
all the world's data communication.

We'll call it XML!

What could go wrong?!

Hold on...
XML?
Really?
I thought this was a story about YAML.
What does XML have to do with it?

Patience...


## Whence YAML?

According to my records...

* The first mention of "YML" was by Clark Evans on
  `Tue, 30 Nov 1999 22:27:00 -0500 (EST)`
* The first mention of "YAML" was by Simeon Simeonov on
  `Mon, 14 Feb 2000 13:10:34 -0800`
* Clark announced his purchase of [yaml.org](https://yaml.org) on
  `Fri, 5 Jan 2001 02:50:35 -0500 (EST)`
* Clark published "YAML Draft 0.1" on `Fri, 11 May 2001 15:50:31 -0500`,
  claiming:
    * YAML is a straight-forward markup language, offering an alternative to XML,
      borrowing ideas from C, HTML, Perl, and Python.
    * YAML texts are brief and readable.
    * YAML is very expressive and extensible.
    * YAML has a simple stream based interface.
    * YAML uses data structures native to your programming language.
    * YAML is easy to implement, perhaps too easy.
    * YAML has a solid information model, no exceptions no mess.
* Clark was made aware of Brian Ingerson and his work on
  [Data::Denter](https://metacpan.org/pod/Data::Denter) on
  `Sun, 13 May 2001 15:39:53 -0000`
    * Hey! That's me!!!
    * Brian was rebranded to Ingy in 2005 :)

Where are these "records"?
Patience...


### Primordial YAML

Here's one of Clark's earliest stabs at YAML:
```
$invoice           00034843
$date              12-JAN-2001
%buyer
    $given-name    Chris
    $family-name   Dumars
    %address
        $line1     458 Wittigen's Way
        $line2     Suite #292
        $city      Royal Oak
        $state     MI
        $postal    48046
@order
    %product
        $id        BL394D
        $desc      Grade A, Leather Hide Basketball
        $price     $450.00
        $quantity  4
    %product
        $id        BL4438H
        $desc      Super Hoop (tm)
        $price     $2,392.00
        $quantity  1
$comments
    Mr. Dumars is frequently gone in the morning
    so it is best advised to try things in late
    afternoon. \nIf Joe isn't around, try his house\
    keeper, Nancy Billsmer @ (734) 338-4338.
%delivery
    $method        UZS Express Overnight
    $price         $45.50
$tax               0%
$total             $4237.50
```

Sjoerd Visscher countered with something that may have inspired YAML's "flow"
(think JSON) style:
```
%[
  invoice            [00034843]
  date               [12-JAN-2001]
  buyer %[
      given-name     [Chris]
      family-name    [Dumars]
      address %[
          line1      [458 Wittigen's Way]
          line2      [Suite #292]
          city       [Royal Oak]
          state      [MI]
          postal     [48046]
      ]
  ]
  product @[
      %[
          id         [BL394D]
          desc       [Grade A, Leather Hide Basketball]
          price      [$450.00]
          quantity   [4]
      ]
      %[
          id         [BL4438H]
          desc       [Super Hoop (tm)]
          price      [$2,392.00]
          quantity   [1]
      ]
  ]
  comments[

  ]
  delivery%[
      method         [UZS Express Overnight]
      price          [$45.50]
  ]
  tax                [$0.00]
  total              [$4237.50]
]
```

The next day, Oren Ben-Kiki offered:
```

Spooky...

Now we're cooking with nitro!


## Back to XML

OK, cool, but what's any of this got to do with XML?

Back then Clark Evans, Oren Ben-Kiki and a host of others were trying to figure
out how to make XML simpler.
This world-wide discussion happened on the
[XML-DEV](http://www.xml.org/xml-dev/) mailing list, starting in 1997 and
continuing until at least last Wednesday.
In November 1999 a faction of that list started talking about SML, a simpler
more minimal XML.
They decided to create their own SML-DEV mailing list.
It was there that Clark and Oren eventually decided to break away from angle
brackets altogether and... YAML was born.

At that time Ingy had landed a job in Open Source Heaven (aka ActiveState) and
was sitting in a row of Perl programmers, across from a row of Python
programmers.
He was working on the Perl core's plain text serialization language,
Data::Dumper.
In the Spring of 2001, he must have caught some Python fever, because he made
Data::Denter, an indentation based serialization language module for CPAN.

In May, he got an email from Clark which led to an hours long phone call.
He couldn't stop muttering "YAML YAML YAML" for months.
_Try it yourself. It just feels so good coming off the tongue!_


## Back to SML

Over the next 5 years or so, Oren, Clark and I(ngy) worked non-stop (on a
mailing list of course) getting YAML off the ground.
They mentioned SML from time to time.

In 2017, I decided to look for the SML-DEV mailing list and to my surprise it
still existed on yahoo.com!
I searched the list to find out how I was brought into the mess in the first
place.
I found a single post from Jim Flanagan telling Clark about me, the same day
that Clark reached out to me.

```
Date: Sun, 13 May 2001 15:39:53 -0000
Subject: Re: YAML Draft 0.1
In-Reply-To: <20010511155031.A30060@...>
From: jimfl@...

This looks very similar to the format of the Perl module Data::Denter
(by Brian Ingerson) for which there is already a fine parser available
(in perl, of course).

See:

http://search.cpan.org/doc/INGY/Data-Denter-0.12/Denter.pod
```

Next I searched for more info on Jim and it turns out we lived in the same city.
Practically the same neighborhood!
I emailed the unwitting catalyst of modern day YAML and invited him to lunch.
We had sushi.

In 2020 I went back to the SML list to look for something and got hit with:

```
Announcement: End of Yahoo Groups Weâ€™re shutting down the Yahoo Groups website
on December 15, 2020 and members will no longer be able to send or receive
emails from Yahoo Groups. Yahoo Mail features will continue to function as
expected and there will be no changes to your Yahoo Mail account, emails,
photos or other inbox content. There will also be no changes to other Yahoo
properties or services. You can find more information about the Yahoo Groups
shutdown and alternative service options on this help page.
```

Boooooo!

Not only that, I could no longer see the SML-DEV content.

After a few tears, the internet graciously led me to archive.org where I found
the entire SML-DEV list (every email!) downloadable as a [single file](
https://archive.org/download/yahoo-groups-2016-06-18T17-13-11Z-9329be/sml-dev.sbxL0kc.warc.gz)!
Hmmm... `.warc.gz`.
I know `gz` but `warc` looked scary.

I took a closer look inside and it was actually quite simple.

WARC is the Web ARChive format!
Just an alternation of plain text header lines and JSON payloads. 

Since JSON is a proper subset of YAML, I figured I could handle it.

The next morning I cobbled together a [shell command pipeline](
https://github.com/yaml/sml-dev-archive/tree/master/fetch) that turned 5000+
emails into a nice readable plain text file that I've been scouring and
devouring ever since.
I threw the whole schmear up onto a [GitHub repository](
https://github.com/yaml/sml-dev-archive#readme) so you can [read it](
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yaml/sml-dev-archive/master/sml-dev.txt) too.


## Back to the Future

There is such a long and rich history of how YAML got here.
I could go on for days.
Perhaps I'll get back to some of that in a later post.

My focus is currently (as it's been since 2001) on the Future of YAML.
I want to tell you where YAML is _going_!!!

There's a lot of fantastic new activity in the YAML language, and some new
dedicated people helping to move it forward.
We can't wait to share more of the YAML adventure as it unfolds...


## Back to the Summer

Did you think YAML was created to be a configuration language?

We never even considered it back then.

Sometimes the world decides for you.

Later on I tell you more about YAML's history, but for now I'm gonna enjoy this
Summer Sunday.
