**YAMLScript**, or **YS** ("wise") is a functional programming
language with a clean syntax that is also 100% valid **[YAML](
https://yaml.org)**.
It was designed to be easily embedded into existing YAML files in order to
provide the logic, interpolation and data transformation capabilities that many
YAML users need.
Created by YAML inventor and lead maintainer, Ingy d√∂t Net, YAMLScript solves
these needs beautifully for all YAML users and uses.
