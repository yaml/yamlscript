title: YS Use Cases

The primary goal of the YS project is to make YAML be able to do more.

While the original goal of YAML was to be a human readable data serialization
language, YAML has found its place in the world primarily as a software
configuration language.

YS has a strong focus on making YAML as good as possible for configuration.
That said, YS is a complete, general purpose, functional programming language,
that builds on top of the success of YAML, JSON, Clojure, Java and other
technologies.
It embeds perfectly into your YAML files, enabling almost any need you might
have there, but it it also stands on its own in many other contexts.

We hope you will find lots of excellent uses for YS.
If you discover use cases that we haven't thought of, please let us know!
We'll showcase them here.

    There are many more YS use cases to be added here.
    Bear with us as we get them added.
