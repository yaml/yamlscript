**YS** (aka YAMLScript) is a new programming language that uses
[YAML](https://yaml.org) as its syntax.

It can be easily embedded into your YAML files to make them dynamic at load
time.
YS is also a complete, functional, general purpose language with a mature
collection of external libraries that can be used for any number of programming
tasks.

Most existing YAML files (and all JSON files) are already valid YS programs.
You can process YAML/YS files with the `ys` CLI program or load them from your
favorite programming language using a YS loader library/module.

YS currently has working loader libraries for:
[Clojure](https://clojars.org/org.yamlscript/clj-yamlscript),
[Go](https://github.com/yaml/yamlscript-go),
[Java](https://clojars.org/org.yamlscript/yamlscript),
[Julia](https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages/General/YAMLScript),
[NodeJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@yaml/yamlscript),
[Perl](https://metacpan.org/dist/YAMLScript/view/lib/YAMLScript.pod),
[Python](https://pypi.org/project/yamlscript/),
[Raku](https://raku.land/zef:ingy/YAMLScript),
[Ruby](https://rubygems.org/search?query=yamlscript) and
[Rust](https://crates.io/crates/yamlscript).

It has [binary releases](https://github.com/yaml/yamlscript/releases)
for `ys` and `libyamlscript` that you can install with:

```bash
$ curl https://yamlscript.org/install | bash
```

    #### YS Status

    YS is currently a fully functional programming language, but
    the v0 API has not yet been declared stable.
    A stable v0 API is planned for Q2 2024.
    Once the v0 API is declared stable, it will always remain backwards
    compatible.
