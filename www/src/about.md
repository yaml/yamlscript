**YAMLScript** is a new programming language that uses [YAML](
https://yaml.org) as its syntax.

It can be easily embedded into your YAML files to make them dynamic at load
time.
YAMLScript is also a complete, functional, general purpose language with a
mature collection of external libraries that can be used for any number of
programming tasks.

Most existing YAML files (and all JSON files) are already valid YAMLScript
programs.
You can process YAML/YAMLScript files with the `ys` CLI program or load them
from your favorite programming language using a YAMLScript loader
library/module.

YAMLScript currently has working loader libraries for:
[Clojure](https://clojars.org/org.yamlscript/clj-yamlscript),
[Go](https://github.com/yaml/yamlscript-go),
[Java](https://clojars.org/org.yamlscript/yamlscript),
[Julia](https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages/General/YAMLScript),
[NodeJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@yaml/yamlscript),
[Perl](https://metacpan.org/dist/YAMLScript/view/lib/YAMLScript.pod),
[Python](https://pypi.org/project/yamlscript/),
[Raku](https://raku.land/zef:ingy/YAMLScript),
[Ruby](https://rubygems.org/search?query=yamlscript) and
[Rust](https://crates.io/crates/yamlscript).
It has [binary releases](https://github.com/yaml/yamlscript/releases)
for `ys` and `libyamlscript` that you can install with:

```bash
$ curl https://yamlscript.org/install | bash
```

> #### YAMLScript Status
>
> YAMLScript is currently a fully functional programming language, but
> the v0 API has not yet been declared stable.
> A stable v0 API is planned for Q2 2024.
> Once the v0 API is declared stable, it will always remain backwards
compatible.
