YS is an open-source project and we welcome contributions from the community.
There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts,
improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or
writing code which can be incorporated into YS itself.

Want to help out with YS?
Great!
Here are some ways you can contribute:

* **Use YS** —
  The more people that use YS, the more feedback we get, and the better
  the language becomes.
* **[Report Bugs](https://github.com/yaml/yamlscript/issues/)** —
  If you find a bug in YS, please report it.
* **[Request Features](https://github.com/yaml/yamlscript/discussions/)** —
  If you have an idea for a feature in YS, please let us know.
* **Submit Pull Requests** —
  If you know your way around [Clojure](
  https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started) a bit (or are willing to learn),
  try improving YS by submitting a code pull request.

    Adding a new function or fixing a bug in the [YS Standard Library](
    https://github.com/yaml/yamlscript/blob/main/core/src/ys/std.clj) is a great
    way to start.

* **Write Documentation** —
  Go [here](../doc/index.md) to learn how to contribute to the YS documentation.
* **Write Tests** —
  Have a look at these tests:
    * [YS Compiler/Core Tests](
      https://github.com/yaml/yamlscript/tree/main/core/test/yamlscript)
    * [YS Runtime Tests](
      https://github.com/yaml/yamlscript/tree/main/ys/test)
