* What is YS?
-->
<h1 class="empty"></h1><!-- disable auto title -->

**YS** (pronounced "wise", aka YAMLScript) is a functional programming
language with a clean syntax that is also 100% valid **[YAML](
https://yaml.org)**.
It was designed to be easily embedded into existing YAML files in order to
provide the logic, interpolation and data transformation capabilities that many
YAML users need.
Created by YAML inventor and lead maintainer, Ingy d√∂t Net, YS solves these
needs beautifully for all YAML users and uses.

!!! note "YS Exercism Track"

    YS is now available as a programming language learning track on
    **[Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/yamlscript)**.
    It's a great way to learn YS and get feedback from experienced mentors.
    Check it out!

If you work with apps and frameworks that use YAML for configuration, you can
simplify your complex YAML files using YS, even if the app or framework
does not support it natively.
YS lets you include data from external files and other sources, make use of
hundreds of existing standard functions, and even define your own variables and
functions.
You can filter, map, merge, reduce, generate, concatenate, interpolate and
manipulate your data as you wish.
YS provides these things with syntax that is minimal and unobtrusive, keeping
your clean YAML data clean.

!!! note "YAMLScript at KubeCon 2024"

    Slides and information from Ingy's [KubeCon 2024 talk](
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdi3Q4Wrt48)
    are available [here](https://yamlscript.org/kubeys24).
    The highlight was [HelmYS](https://github.com/kubeys/helmys) a new Helm
    post-renderer that lets you template Helm charts with YS (which is actual
    YAML).

Like many new languages, YS was built over an existing robust language,
[Clojure](https://clojure.org), which in turn was built over
[Java](https://java.com).
The power of Clojure and Java is available to YS users via the YS runtime
interpreter, `ys`.
However, the `ys` command is compiled into a single standalone native binary
executable file.
This means that <u>No Java or JVM</u> installation is required to use YS, and
startup/execution speed is very fast.

YS also produces the `libyamlscript.so` shared library.
It has [binding modules for 10 programming languages](doc/bindings.md) including
Go, JavaScript, Python and Rust, with many more on the way.
These modules can be used in your programs to load normal YAML files as well as
YS enhanced ones.

There are many ways to use YS:

* Simplify your existing YAML configs
  * Works great with CI/CD, Helm, Docker, Ansible, etc.
  * Check out [HelmYS](https://github.com/kubeys/helmys), a tool for using
    YS in Kubernetes Helm chart templates painlessly.
* [Load YS (or YAML) in your programs](doc/bindings.md)
  * Available in 10 programming languages (and counting)
* Program in YS
  * Learn how at [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/yamlscript)
* [Script Automation with YS](doc/examples.md)
  * Many used in the [YS repository](https://github.com/yaml/yamlscript)
* [Compile YS to binary executables](doc/binary.md)
  * Fast, standalone, no-source software distribution
* [Query and Transform YAML (and JSON) data](doc/query.md)
  * Use the `ys` command line tool similar to `jq` or `yq`
