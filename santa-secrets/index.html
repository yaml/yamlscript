<p>In December 2023 YAMLScript is a work in progress.</p>
<p>This is not to say that it's a toy proof of concept.
It has a working compiler, runtime and CLI.
It has unit tests that must pass for every commit pushed to the main branch.
It's well thought out and has a clear direction that I continually vet with a
small group of talented and trusted people.
It has regular <a href="https://github.com/yaml/yamlscript/releases">releases</a>.</p>
<p>But that in turn not to say that you should use it in production today.
I encourage you to start playing with it, and I'm committed to backwards
compatibility for stable releases.
But we're not quite there yet.
Caveat usor!</p>
<p>YAMLScript is evolving fast.
While I'm writing these posts, I'm also writing the code for new features and
fixing bugs as I go.
I've had the Advent plan for over a month now, and I had planned to be further
along before December 1st, but such are the time estimates of hackers.</p>
<p>I am attempting to make sure that the code examples in these posts are always
using the implemented features, but sometimes I may fall a few hours behind.
Often I need to write the examples using code patterns that actually work but
are not the ones I preferred to best make a point.</p>
<p>As I fix bugs, implement features and tweak the language, I will update the
posts accordingly.
If you see something that bugs you, try taking another look after a few days.
It probably bugged me too!</p>
<p>Be patient with me.</p>
<p>If I had to guess, I'd say that YAMLScript v0 will be have a stable release
sometime before March 2024.
I'll continue blogging the progress as I go, so it shouldn't be hard for you to
decide when to start using YAMLScript for real.</p>
<p>Overall the whole thing is going extremely well, and I'm having a lot of fun.
It's important to be transparent with you about where things are at.</p>
<p>Stick with me... This is going to be awesome!</p>
