<p>&nbsp;</p><details><summary style="color:#888">Santa's little secrets...</summary><p>In December 2023 YAMLScript is a work in progress.</p><p>This is not to say that it's a toy proof of concept. It has a working compiler, runtime and CLI. It has unit tests that must pass for every commit pushed to the main branch. It's well thought out and has a clear direction that I continually vet with a small group of talented and trusted people. It has regular <a href="https://github.com/yaml/yamlscript/releases">releases</a>.</p><p>But that in turn not to say that you should use it in production today. I encourage you to start playing with it, and I'm committed to backwards compatibility for stable releases. But we're not quite there yet. Caveat usor!</p><p>YAMLScript is evolving fast. While I'm writing these posts, I'm also writing the code for new features and fixing bugs as I go. I've had the Advent plan for over a month now, and I had planned to be further along before December 1st, but such are the time estimates of hackers.</p><p>I am attempting to make sure that the code examples in these posts are always using the implemented features, but sometimes I may fall a few hours behind. Often I need to write the examples using code patterns that actually work but are not the ones I preferred to best make a point.</p><p>As I fix bugs, implement features and tweak the language, I will update the posts accordingly. If you see something that bugs you, try taking another look after a few days. It probably bugged me too!</p><p>Be patient with me.</p><p>If I had to guess, I'd say that YAMLScript v0 will be have a stable release sometime before March 2024. I'll continue blogging the progress as I go, so it shouldn't be hard for you to decide when to start using YAMLScript for real.</p><p>Overall the whole thing is going extremely well, and I'm having a lot of fun. It's important to be transparent with you about where things are at.</p><p>Stick with me... This is going to be awesome!</p><p>— Ingy döt Net</p></details>
