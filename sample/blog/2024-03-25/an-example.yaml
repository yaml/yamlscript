# /v0/ starts in "data mode"

# This `=>` preamble loads reusable data and code:
=>:
  # Set `vars` to an external data mapping:
  vars =: load('data.yaml')
  # Load a local custom YS library file that has a `rot13` function:
  load: "rot13.ys"


# The rest of the file is normal YAML data.
# It could have been a massive YAML file that we wanted to enhance.
# The lines above lets us do that cleanly.
# Now we can use `::` or `!` to switch to "code mode" at any point:

some: plain string
multi: ! |
  foo
  bar
  $(vars.name)
person:
  name:: vars.name
  age:: 6 * vars.number
  encrypted pw:: vars.password.rot13()
numbers:: 1 .. vars.number
