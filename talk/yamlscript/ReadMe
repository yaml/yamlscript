What's the best language for writing scripts?
Is it Bash? Perl? Raku? YAML?

Huh? YAML's not even a scripting language...

Well it is now, and it might be your go to language after this talk!

Ingy wants to show you how to be super productive with nice clean functional
YAML code.

Welcome to YAMLScript!

While YAMLScript is focused on making YAML configuration be incredible, it's
also a complete functional programming language.

It comes with an extensive standard library, tons of external real world
external libraries, all the things you expect a real programming language to
have.

How is that possible? It's because YAMLScript jit-compiles to another real
world language, Clojure.

But while Clojure is a Lisp that runs on the JVM, YAMLScript looks closer to
Python and needs no JVM.

It's clean, fast and a great way to script just about anything.
And if your script needs data, well I hope you know we got you covered!

Come hear Ingy dot Net tell you about this great new addition to your day to
day hacking toolbox.
