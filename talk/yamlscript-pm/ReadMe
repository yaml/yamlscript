There's a new YAML loader in town, for both Perl and Raku!

It loads all of your existing YAML files just as expected, but you can also
call functions at any point.

You can include other files, fetch web data or query a database! You can merge,
concat, interpolate & 100s more.

I think you'll love it!At TPRC 2023 I(ngy) talked about Lingy and YAMLScript.

Immediately afterwards all the pieces fell in place to make YAMLScript the most
powerful YAML loader for every language, including Perl and Raku.

While YAMLScript is a complete functional programming language (available right
now) its main focus is to fix most of the problems people have with YAML, and
also take YAML's capabilities to a whole new level.

In this talk, Ingy dot Net will teach you how to use the YAMLScript loader
modules for Perl and Raku.

Then he'll teach you how to easily tame your YAML and do just about anything
you'd normally do from a programming language directly in YAML.

I think you'll be pleasantly surprised just how clean and powerful it is when
you add YAMLScript to your YAML files.
