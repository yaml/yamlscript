There's a lot about the Clojure programming language for a Perl programmer to
like.

It's very dynamic and very practical.
If you think it's just for the JVM, you're very wrong.

Let Ingy teach you the basics of this exciting language including compiling it
to binary and using it directly with Perl!Clojure (pronounced like "closure")
is a programming language that was created to make Java programming not be a
nightmare!

Clojure can use any library written in Java and Java can use any library
written in Clojure.

It's core data structures are immutable yet easy to work with.
This makes it a great functional programming language, and makes concurrency
simple and reliable.

At the same time it supports mutable data structures when you need them (not
very often).
It's a very practical language.

Clojure went beyond Java and the JVM to support other host languages, most
notably JavaScript.

These days Clojure can be run directly without any host (no JVM at all).

It can also be compiled to binary executables and shared libraries.
That means you can write "XS" modules in a very high level language.

Clojure has a Lisp syntax, and if you've been wanting to really learn a Lisp,
Clojure is a very practical one to start with.

In this talk, Ingy dot Net will teach you as much as he can in 50 minutes about
how a Perl programmer can be productive with Clojure.
