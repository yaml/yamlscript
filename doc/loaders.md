title: YAMLScript Loader Libraries
---

YAMLScript is focused on providing a loader library for every programming
language where YAML is used.
Ideally it should be a drop-in replacement for the existing YAML loader library
you are using.

All existing YAML config files are already valid YAMLScript files and using the
YAMLScript loader to load them should work without any changes.
The advantage of using the YAMLScript loader is that they all work the same way
and provide the same capabilities, regardless of the underlying programming
language.

The following loader libraries are currently available:

* [Clojure](https://clojars.org/org.yamlscript/clj-yamlscript)
* [Java](https://clojars.org/org.yamlscript/yamlscript)
* [NodeJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@yaml/yamlscript)
* [Perl](https://metacpan.org/dist/YAMLScript/view/lib/YAMLScript.pod)
* [Python](https://pypi.org/project/yamlscript/)
* [Raku](https://raku.land/zef:ingy/YAMLScript)
* [Ruby](https://rubygems.org/search?query=yamlscript)
* [Rust](https://crates.io/crates/yamlscript)
