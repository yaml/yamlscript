title: Necessary YAML Knowledge
---

YAML was created to make data simple... most of the time.

It was also created to give people a lot of control over how they write their
data.
There's actually quite a bit about YAML that you need to know to use it to
write YAMLScript.

This document will cover all the YAML syntax, concepts, and vocabulary that
you need to know to write YAMLScript effectively.

> NOTE: When a word or phrase is presented in double quotes, it is a YAML
vocabulary term that you should commit to memory.
These terms are used consistently throughout the YAMLScript documentation (and
also YAML specification and other YAML-related writings).
