# `ys::fs` â€” The YS File System Library

Many of these functions can take a single argument or a list of arguments,
or a single list of arguments.
They will return their results in the same format.


```mdys:stdlib
File System Queries:
  abs?(Path) Bool: Path is absolute
  dir?(Path) Bool: Path is a directory
  empty?(Path) Bool: Path is empty (file or directory)
  exec?(Path) Bool: Path is executable
  exists?(Path) Bool: Path exists
  file?(Path) Bool: Path is a regular file
  link?(Path) Bool: Path is a symbolic link
  read?(Path) Bool: Path is readable
  rel?(Path) Bool: Path is relative
  size?(Path) Bool: File is not empty
  write?(Path) Bool: Path is writable

Short Form Query Functions:
  d(Path) Bool: Path is a directory
  e(Path) Bool: Path exists
  f(Path) Bool: Path is a regular file
  l(Path) Bool: Path is a symbolic link
  r(Path) Bool: Path is readable
  s(Path) Bool: Path is not empty
  w(Path) Bool: Path is writable
  x(Path) Bool: Path is executable
  z(Path) Bool: Path is empty (file or directory)

File System Getters:
  abs(Path) Path: Get the absolute path
  basename(Path Ext?) File: Get the file name of a path, without extension
  ctime(Path) Int: Get the creation time of a file
  dirname(Path) Dir: Get the directory name of a path
  filename(Path) File: Get the file name of a path
  glob(Path) [Path]: Glob a path
  ls(dir) [File]: List a directory
  mtime(Path) Int: Get the modification time of a file
  path(Path) Path: Get the canonical path
  readlink(Path) Path: Get the path of a symbolic link
  rel(Path) Path: Get the relative path
  which(name) Path: Find the path of an executable

File System Mutators:
  cp(Path Path): Copy a file
  cp-r(Path Path): Copy a directory
  mkdir(Path) Dir: Create a directory
  mkdir-p(Path) Dir: Create a directory and all parent directories
  mv(Path Path): Move a file
  rm(Path) Path: Remove a file
  rm-r(Path) Path: Remove a directory and all files in it
  rmdir(Path) Path: Remove a directory
  touch(Path) Path: Create a file if it doesn't exist, or update its
    modification time
```
