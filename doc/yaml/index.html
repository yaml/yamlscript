There's actually quite a bit about YAML that you need to know to use it to write YAMLScript.</p><p>This document will cover all the YAML syntax, concepts and vocabulary that you need to know to write YAMLScript effectively.</p><blockquote><p>NOTE: When a word or phrase is presented in double quotes, it is a YAML vocabulary term that you should commit to memory. These terms are used consistently throughout the YAMLScript documentation (and also YAML specification and other YAML-related writings).</p></blockquote><h2>YAML Data Model</h2><p>YAML represents the same kind of data as JSON: &quot;mappings&quot;, &quot;sequences&quot; and &quot;scalars&quot;.</p><ul><li>A &quot;mapping&quot; is an unordered collection of key-value pairs where each key is unique. Mappings are also known as 'hashes', 'dictionaries', 'objects' or 'associative arrays' in other languages, but in YAML they are always called mappings.</li><li>A &quot;sequence&quot; is an ordered collection of values. Sequences are also known as 'arrays', 'lists' or 'vectors' elsewhere.</li><li>A &quot;scalar&quot; is a single value, like a number, string, keyword, boolean or even a null value. Scalars are also known as 'atoms' or 'primitives' elsewhere.</li></ul><p>YAML adds just a few things to this basic data model:</p><ul><li>YAML &quot;streams&quot; can consist of one YAML &quot;document&quot; (the normal case), multiple documents separated by <code>---</code> or <code>...</code> or no documents at all.<ul><li>A YAML &quot;stream&quot; is all of the YAML text in a single YAML file or YAML string passed to a YAML &quot;loader&quot;.</li><li>A YAML &quot;document&quot; is a single YAML data &quot;node&quot;.</li><li>A &quot;node&quot; is a single value in the YAML data model: a mapping, sequence or scalar.</li></ul></li><li>Any YAML node in a document can be given a name (called an &quot;anchor&quot;) and referred to by that name elsewhere in the document using an &quot;alias&quot;.<ul><li>An anchor looks like <code>&amp;foo</code> and an alias looks like <code>*foo</code>.</li><li>Example:<pre class="language-yaml"><code class="language-yaml"><span class="token key atrule">first</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token important">&amp;anchor</span><br>  <span class="token key atrule">a</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> mapping<br><span class="token key atrule">second</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token important">*anchor</span>  <span class="token comment"># Both values are the same mapping.</span></code></pre></li></ul></li><li>A mapping key can be any &quot;kind&quot; of YAML node, (not just a scalar node like in JSON).<ul><li>This is not commonly used either in YAML or YAMLScript, but it is completely valid.</li><li>The word &quot;kind&quot; is used to refer to those three different YAML node shapes: &quot;scalar&quot;, &quot;mapping&quot; or &quot;sequence&quot;.</li></ul></li><li>Any YAML node can have a &quot;explicit tag&quot;.<ul><li>A tag looks like <code>!foo-bar</code> and is used to associate a word or string with a that YAML node.</li><li>Tags typically instruct a YAML loader how to interpret the node.</li><li>Even though it is rare to see tags in YAML, part of the loading process is to assign a tag to every node that lacks an explicit one. This process is known as &quot;implicit tagging&quot; or &quot;tag resolution&quot;.</li><li>In YAMLScript, the tags <code>!yamlscript/v0</code> and just <code>!</code> are quite common. They control the &quot;YAMLScript mode&quot; of a document or node.</li></ul></li></ul><h2>Basic YAML Syntax</h2><p>YAML supports a comment syntax. Comments start with a <code>#</code> and continue to the end of the line. Blank lines are also considered comments.</p><p>We'll show you same YAML examples to illustrate the basic syntax and use comments to explain the concepts as much as possible.</p><p>Example 1: A YAML stream with several syntax elements:</p><pre class="language-yaml"><code class="language-yaml"><span class="token comment"># A line starting with `---` is used to begin a new document.</span><br><span class="token comment"># It is not required for the first document in a stream.</span><br><span class="token comment"># It is common to put any tag or anchor for the top level node on the same</span><br><span class="token comment"># line as the `---`.</span><br><br><span class="token punctuation">---</span><br><br><span class="token comment"># The top level node of this document is a mapping:</span><br><span class="token comment"># Mapping "pairs" consist of a "key" and a "value" separated by a colon.</span><br><br><span class="token comment"># For the first pair we have a scalar key and a scalar value.</span><br><span class="token comment"># Notice how the key is single-quoted and the value is double-quoted.</span><br><br><span class="token key atrule">'first-key'</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"first-value"</span><br><br><span class="token comment"># The second pair has another scalar key and scalar value.</span><br><br><span class="token key atrule">second-key</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> second value<br><br><span class="token comment"># Notice that both of them are unquoted.</span><br><span class="token comment"># Scalars of can be expressed without quotes.</span><br><span class="token comment"># This is very common in YAML and very important in YAMLScript.</span><br><br><span class="token comment"># The kind of quoting (or lack thereof) is called the scalar's "style" in YAML.</span><br><span class="token comment"># We'll talk more about styles later.</span><br><br><span class="token comment"># Mapping pair values can be any kind of YAML node.</span><br><span class="token comment"># Mappings and sequences can also be used as values and nested to an arbitrary</span><br><span class="token comment"># depth.</span><br><span class="token comment"># This is accomplished by indenting the nested node using one or more spaces.</span><br><br><span class="token key atrule">third-key</span><span

and aren't very common in YAMLScript.</p><blockquote><p>TODO: This section is incomplete.</p></blockquote><h2>Common YAML/YAMLScript Gotchas</h2><p>All YAMLScript files are required to be valid YAML. YAMLScript uses most of YAML's capabilities and flexibilities to create a clean programming language (one that doesn't look like just a bunch of data).</p><p>Unfortunately, this means that you can run into some situations where your YAMLScript looks perfectly fine but is actually invalid YAML.</p><p>YAMLScript can repeat a string with this syntax: <code>'foo' * 3</code> yields <code>'foofoofoo'</code>.</p><p>However, the following is not valid and would cause a YAML parsing error:</p><pre class="language-yaml"><code class="language-yaml"><span class="token key atrule">say</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> 'foo' * 3</code></pre><p>This is because YAML sees a single quoted scalar and text is not allowed to follow the closing quote.</p><p>YAMLScript uses the <code>.</code> escaping character to fix this:</p><pre class="language-yaml"><code class="language-yaml"><span class="token key atrule">say</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> .'foo' * 3</code></pre><p>Now the right-hand side is an unquoted scalar whose value is <code>.'foo' * 3</code>. YAMLScript will ignore the leading <code>.</code> and evaluate the expression as expected.</p><p>This <code>.</code> escaping character can be used anywhere that you want a scalar to be &quot;plain&quot; (unquoted) but it happens to start with a character that happens to be YAML syntax.</p><p>Some examples:</p><pre class="language-yaml"><code class="language-yaml"><span class="token comment"># Here [3 4 5] is a YAMLScript vector, not a YAML sequence.</span><br><span class="token comment"># Again we make the entire RHS a plain scalar by starting with a `.`.</span><br><span class="token key atrule">say</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> .<span class="token punctuation">[</span>3 4 5<span class="token punctuation">]</span>.reverse()</code></pre></main><aside class="post__aside"><nav class="post__pagination"></nav></aside></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__content"><ul class="hero__social-links"><li><a href="https://github.com/yaml/yamlscript" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a></li><li><a href="/feed.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RSS</a></li></ul><p class="footer__attribution">Powered by <a href="https://www.11ty.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eleventy</a>.
