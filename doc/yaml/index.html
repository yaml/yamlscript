There's actually quite a bit about YAML that you need to know in order to write YAMLScript well. Remember, all valid YAMLScript is required to be valid YAML syntax.</p><p>This document will cover all the YAML syntax, concepts and vocabulary that you need to know to write YAMLScript effectively.</p><blockquote><p>NOTE: When a word or phrase is presented in double quotes here, it is intended to be a YAML vocabulary term that you should commit to memory. These terms are used consistently throughout the YAMLScript documentation (and also the YAML specification and other YAML-related writings).</p></blockquote><h2>YAML Data Model</h2><p>YAML represents the same kinds of data as JSON: &quot;mappings&quot;, &quot;sequences&quot; and &quot;scalars&quot;.</p><ul><li>A &quot;mapping&quot; is an unordered collection of key-value pairs where each key is unique. Mappings are also known as 'hashes', 'dictionaries', 'objects' or 'associative arrays' in other languages, but in YAML they are always called mappings.</li><li>A &quot;sequence&quot; is an ordered collection of values. Sequences are also known as 'arrays', 'lists' or 'vectors' elsewhere.</li><li>A &quot;scalar&quot; is a single value, like a number, string, keyword, boolean or even a null value. Scalars are also known as 'atoms' or 'primitives' elsewhere.</li></ul><p>YAML adds just a few things to this basic data model:</p><ul><li>YAML &quot;streams&quot; can consist of one YAML &quot;document&quot; (the normal case), multiple documents separated by <code>---</code> / <code>...</code>, or no documents at all.<ul><li>A YAML &quot;stream&quot; is all of the YAML text in a single YAML file or YAML string passed to a YAML &quot;loader&quot; or generated by a YAML &quot;dumper&quot;.</li><li>A YAML &quot;document&quot; is a single YAML data &quot;node&quot;.</li><li>A &quot;node&quot; is a single value in the YAML data model: a mapping, sequence or scalar.</li></ul></li><li>Any YAML node in a document can be given a name (called an &quot;anchor&quot;) and referred to by that name elsewhere in the document using an &quot;alias&quot;.<ul><li>An anchor looks like <code>&amp;foo</code> and an alias looks like <code>*foo</code>.</li><li>Example:<pre class="language-yaml"><code class="language-yaml"><span class="token key atrule">first</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token important">&amp;anchor</span><br>  <span class="token key atrule">a</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> mapping<br><span class="token key atrule">second</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token important">*anchor</span>  <span class="token comment"># Both values are the same mapping: {"a": "mapping"}.</span></code></pre></li></ul></li><li>A mapping key can be any &quot;kind&quot; of YAML node, (not just a scalar node like in JSON).<ul><li>This is not commonly used either in YAML or YAMLScript, but it is completely valid.</li><li>The term &quot;kind&quot; is used to refer to those three different YAML node shapes: &quot;mapping&quot;, &quot;sequence&quot; or &quot;scalar&quot;.</li></ul></li><li>Any YAML node can have a &quot;explicit tag&quot;.<ul><li>A tag looks like <code>!foo-bar</code> and is used to associate a word or string with a that YAML node.</li><li>Tags typically instruct a YAML loader how to interpret the node.</li><li>Even though it is rare to see tags in YAML, part of the loading process is to assign a tag to every node that lacks an explicit one. This process is known as &quot;implicit tagging&quot; or &quot;tag resolution&quot;.</li><li>In YAMLScript, the tags <code>!yamlscript/v0</code> and just <code>!</code> are quite common. They control the YAMLScript &quot;<a href="../modes">mode</a>&quot; of a particular node.</li></ul></li></ul><h2>Basic YAML Syntax</h2><p>YAML supports a comment syntax. Comments start with a <code>#</code> and continue to the end of the line. Blank lines are also considered comments. The <code>#</code> must be at the start of the line or preceded by whitespace.</p><p>We'll show you some YAML examples to illustrate the basic syntax and use YAML comments to explain the concepts as much as possible.</p><p>Example 1: A YAML stream with several syntax elements:</p><pre class="language-yaml"><code class="language-yaml"><span class="token comment"># A line starting with `---` is used to begin a new document.</span><br><span class="token comment"># It is not required for the first document in a stream.</span><br><span class="token comment"># It is common to put any tag or anchor for the top level node on the same</span><br><span class="token comment"># line as the `---`.</span><br><br><span class="token punctuation">---</span><br><br><span class="token comment"># Let's start with the common mapping and sequence nodes.</span><br><span class="token comment"># Mappings are a group of "pairs", each consisting of a "key" and a "value"</span><br><span class="token comment"># separated by a colon.</span><br><span class="token comment"># Sequences are a group of nodes where each one is prefixed by a dash.</span><br><span class="token comment"># Both the colon and the dash must be followed by a whitespace to be valid.</span><br><br><span class="token comment"># The top level node of this document is a mapping.</span><br><br><span class="token comment"># For the first pair we have a scalar key and a scalar value.</span><br><span class="token comment"># Notice how the key is single-quoted and the value is double-quoted.</span><br><br><span class="token key atrule">'first-key'</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"first-value"</span><br><br><span class="token comment"># The second pair has another scalar key and

unquoted.</span><br><span class="token comment"># Scalars of can be expressed with or without quotes.</span><br><span class="token comment"># This is very common in YAML and very important in YAMLScript.</span><br><br><span class="token comment"># The kind of quoting (or lack thereof) is called the scalar's "style" in YAML.</span><br><span class="token comment"># The different quoting styles have different encoding rules and different</span><br><span class="token comment"># semantics.</span><br><span class="token comment"># There are actually 5 distinct scalar styles in YAML: plain, single quoted,</span><br><span class="token comment"># double quoted, literal and folded.</span><br><span class="token comment"># We'll cover these styles in more detail in a second.</span><br><br><span class="token comment"># Mapping pair values can be any kind of YAML node.</span><br><span class="token comment"># Mappings and sequences can also be used as values and nested to an arbitrary</span><br><span class="token comment"># depth.</span><br><span class="token comment"># This is accomplished by indenting the nested node using one or more

Some of these are used in YAMLScript, so it's good to know about them.</p><pre><code># YAML has a top level &quot;directive&quot; syntax.
# There are only 2 directives defined by the YAML 1.2 specification:
# This is the first one, the &quot;YAML directive&quot;.
# It simply specifies the version of the YAML specification in play.

%YAML 1.2

# The second directive is the &quot;TAG directive&quot;.
# It allows you to specify a shorthand for a tag URI.

%TAG !ys! tag:yamlscript.org,2022:

# To date, directives are not used in YAMLScript.

# The `---` indicator is required to start a new document if you have used any
# directives (even on the first document).

---

# YAML allows a mapping key to be any node, not just a scalar.
# In other words it allows collections or even aliases to be used as keys.

- &amp;map1
  a: value
# Here it is obvious that the key is a mapping.
- *map1 : 42
# Here we are using YAML's &quot;explicit key&quot; syntax (`?`) to specify the key.
- ? [a, flow, sequence]
  : 42
# We can use `?` with block collections too.
- ? a: block
    mapping: key
  : 43
# We can even use it for literals scalar keys.
- ? |-
    a literal
    scalar key
  : 44

---

# The collection key does have a good use case in YAMLScript.
# Consider this `for` loop:

for a foo(), b bar(), c [1 2 3]:
  say: a + b + c

# YAMLScript requires that the `for […]` key be a plain scalar, and YAML
# requires that plain scalar keys need to be a single line.
# This could lead to unreadable code if we our &quot;for binding&quot; is complex.

# Bute can also do it like this:

for:
  ? a: foo()
    b: bar()
    c: [1 2 3]
  : say: a + b

# Which you might find to be clearer.
