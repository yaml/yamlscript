title: Welcome to the YS Documentation

YS is a still a fairly new language, and this documentation is a work in
progress.

While we hope that you find the information you came looking for here, we know
that there are still many gaps in the documentation.

The good news is **"You Can Help!"**.

Writing great documentation is a team effort, and we are trying to make it as
easy as possible for you to contribute.

Almost every page on this site (including this one!!) has an **"Edit this
page"** button at the top:

![Edit this page image](

As you read the documentation, if you find a typo or something that is unclear,
you can click the "Edit this page" button, make the changes, and submit a pull
request.

Furthermore, most pages (and all the documentation pages) have a **"Discuss this
page"** button at the top:

![Discuss this page image](

If you have ideas on how to improve the page or have questions about the
content, this will take you to a [YS GitHub Discussions](
https://github.com/yaml/yamlscript/discussions) discussion about the page (or to
instructions on how to start a new discussion for a page that doesn't have one
yet).

We look forward to this YS journey together and hope that you will help us make
the documentation the best it can be!
